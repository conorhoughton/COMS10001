\subsection*{4 Recursion}

A process is recursive if it repeats itself in a self-similar way. An
easy example is the factorial
\begin{equation}
n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots 1
\end{equation}
where $n$ is multiplied by $n-1$ and then by $n-2$ and so on down to one; or, put another way
\begin{equation}
n!=n(n-1)!
\end{equation}
and $1!=1$.

In computer science recursion refers to an approach where a problem is
solved by breaking it up into smaller similar problems. In practise
this often means solving a problem using a function that calls
itself. An easy example of recursion is given by the factorial; see
Table~\ref{c_factorial} or, for a fancier version
Table~\ref{c_factorial_fancy}. You will have learned that recursion is
often a good way to implement algorithms on computers, that many
algorithms can be designed recursively and that this is usually the
best way to program them. Being comfortable with recursion is one of
the signs of, and benefits of, learning to program properly! We will
also see that working out the big-oh complexity for many recursive
algorithms can be straight-forward using a set of formula known as
the master equation.

A recursive function consists of two parts, a \lq{}recursive
case\rq{}, what happens normally, here return n*factorial(n-1), and a
\lq{}terminating condition\rq{} or \lq{}base case\rq{}, a set of cases
that the algorithm will always arrive at and can deal with without
calling itself. These are important to avoid infinite recursion.

Our task here is to calculate the algorithmic complexity of recursive
algorithms. The trick is to work out a recursive formula for $T(n)$,
the run time. Consider the factorial example; here
\begin{equation}
T(n)=c+T(n-1)
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant representing the computational time required
for factorial(n) itself, the if statement, the multiplication and so
on. Now we can expand it out
\begin{equation}
T(n)=c+T(n-1)=c+[c+T(n-2)]=2c+T(n-2)
\end{equation}
and this keeps going
\begin{equation}
T(n)=2c+T(n-2)=3c+T(n-3)=4c+T(n-4)=\ldots = (n-1)c+T(1)
\end{equation}
so factorial is $O(n)$. 

Another approach is to use an ansatz, that is to guess the answer. For
\begin{equation}
T(n)=c+T(n-1)
\end{equation}
we might guess from experience that this has a solution of the form
\begin{equation}
T(n)=An+B
\end{equation}
for some $A$ and $B$ we haven't specified yet. In fact $T(n)=An+B$
represents a whole family of possible solutions corresponding to different $A$s
and $B$s, we just need to show that family contains an actual solution. We do this by substitution. If we substitute into the recursion relation we get
\begin{equation}
An+B=c+A(n-1)+B=An+B+c-A
\end{equation}
which holds provided $A=c$. In otherwords we can make an educated
guess as to the form of the solution and then show by substitution
that there is a solution of this form.

We have already seen another recursive algorithm, although we didn't
write it as one: binary search. A recursive version of binary search is
given in Table~\ref{c_binary_search_recursive}. Here, leaving out
rounding effects and so on, in the worst case
\begin{equation}
T(n)=c+T(n/2)
\end{equation}
which is solved by 
\begin{equation}
T(n)=c\log_2(n)
\end{equation}
because 
\begin{equation}
T(n/2)=c\log_2(n/2)=c\log_2(n)-c\log_2(2)=c\log_2(n)-c
\end{equation}
and so, substituting back into the equation, this is the solution.
Here, again, working out the run time requires that you know how to
solve the recursion relation. Our approach here is to do what we have
been doing, we guess, based on the examples we've studied, and then
show we are correct by substituting back in.

\caption{The recursive function for calculating $n!=n(n-1)\ldots 1$. If $n<2$ it returns 1, giving a terminating condition, it also means $0!=1$ which is a normal mathematical convention, otherwise it calls factorial(n-1). If you trying using this function, note that for even modest values of n, n! is too big to fit into int.\label{c_factorial}}

  false.  Thus ans=a ? b : c is equivalent to the code above. Ternary
